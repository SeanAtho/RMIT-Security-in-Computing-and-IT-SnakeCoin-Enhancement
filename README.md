## Academic Integrity Warning

Cheating is a serious offense. For serious breaches of academic integrity, students can be charged with academic misconduct. Possible penalties include cancellation of results and expulsion, which can result in the cancellation of a student's program.

## Overview of SnakeCoin

A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. In this project, we create a simple blockchain with 20 blocks, including the genesis block (the first block). Each block is linked to the previous one via its hash.

## Implementation

The project implements a `Block` class that defines the structure for each block. The `Block` class includes a method for hashing the blocks.

Two functions are defined outside the `Block` class:

1. `create_genesis_block()`: This function creates the first block in the chain (genesis block).
2. `next_block(last_block)`: This function creates each subsequent block in the chain.

## Running the code

Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your machine. Then, run the script with:

```bash
python3 blockchain.py
```
Replace blockchain.py with the name of the file that contains the code.
